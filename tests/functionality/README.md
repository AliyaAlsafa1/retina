# Tests

This folder holds the test suite for Retina's functionality. New retina applications can be added and tested using the script.py handler.

To perform tests, run this command from the main retina directory using the appropriate arguments.
`./retina/tests/funcionality/script.py app_name expected_output_file_path output_file_path pcap_file`

For some tests, including the basic_test, a pcap_file is not necessary if running Retina offline. In that scenario, you may pass anything into this argument.
